                    The objective of the HTML CSS technology review was to re-create a given webpage as closely as possible. This task was accomplished using HTML and CSS. Below is a link to the webpage.

                <p>
                    This project analyses the comments on the worldwide top trending topics from Twitter and YouTube.The two top trends collected are Got Talent Final and Avengers Endgame. The data sets from both platforms for each topic were collected with R and TAGS. Four social networks were produced and analyzed. The top three commenting actors with replies were identified in each platform. From the analysis of the social networks it was identified that the same three actors were the top contributors in both Twitter datasets. Also, from the four social networks the top actors were not more than five from all the clusters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tools used to produce the datasets were RStudio, TAGS, MS Excel, Gephi, and Ora-Lite. RStudio was used to get the ranking for the trends. Worldwide was selected as the search location for the ranking because it would gather enough comments with replies. The top two trending topics identified were EndGame and GotTalentFinal. The information to be analyzed from the datasets are the comments with replies to identify the top commenting actors. The data sets mined from two social network platforms, Twitter and YouTube. TAGS was used to mine the data from Twitter using hash tags #gottalentfinal and #endgame. RStudio was used to mine the data from YouTube crawling the comments for the videos GotTalent Final and the video Endgame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A total of five thousand comments were collected from each of the four crawls. Five thousand was used in order to gather enough comments with replies. The raw data was cleaned with MS Excel. Only two columns were used, commenter ID and comments. The comments with replies were filtered out and then the handles from these replies were extracted. The four raw and clean datasets along with reports and complete network graphs can be found in the appendix at the end of the report.

            <p>
                The Medical Clinic Database is the final project for the Advanced Database course. The database is developed in SQL and PL/SQL using Oracle SQL Developer. It includes stored functions, procedures, exceptions handlers, anonymous blocks and cursors.</p>
            <p>
                The Medical Clinic Database keeps track of the patients and their medical history, doctors, symptoms, diagnosis, diseases, drugs, and tests. Each patient has a name, date of birth, address, patient number, sex, and a unique patient id. The patient's medical history stores each visit date, reason for the visit, unique visit id, the doctor that performs checkup, patient vitals, diagnosis, and tests performed. Each doctor in the clinic will have a unique doctor id, name, specialization. The patient’s symptoms will be tracked by the description given by the patient during the visit and will include any test results, images or laboratories performed. The tests will have a unique test id, test name and type. The type can be images or laboratory. The images will have a unique image id and will be of type MRI, EKG, Ultrasound, or X-ray. Laboratories will have a unique lab id with type urine and blood. The diagnosis will have a unique diagnosis id, description, code, and related symptoms. Diseases will be tracked by name, unique disease id, symptom, origin, and survivability percentage. Drugs prescribed will be tracked by unique prescription id, drug id, name, prescription date, patient id, doctor id, quantity, number of refills.
