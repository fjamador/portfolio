            <p> 
                Dear Sir or Madam, 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am applying for the Network Engineer Sr. position JOB ID: 450490BR advertised on your website, which I accessed on September 7. I havean Associate in Arts degree from Valencia College in Orlando and next year I will graduate with a B.S. degree in Information Technology from the University of Arkansas Little Rock. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a special interest in networking I have successfully completed the Cisco Certified Network Professional CCNP certification. I also completed courses and certifications in server administration, network security and computer repair that gave me practical experience to work as an IT administrator and a network engineer and PC repair professor.
            </p>
            <p>
                My studies and job experience in networking are both relevant to this position and your corporation. For over six months I have worked at Convergys Corporation as a Senior Associate Data Center Operator remotely monitoring and troubleshooting the Data network. Before this I worked at Windstream Communications as a network analyst identifying, isolating and helping resolve network impacting issues with field personnel, Network Operations Center (NOC) team, and vendor support teams. An additional job strength I would bring to your team is my bilingual (Spanish/English) communication skills with strong technical knowledge and customer service. You will find more detailed information about my achievements in the enclosed résumé. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications in networking with you. I am available for an interview at any time convenient for you. Thank you for your consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely yours,
            </p>
